Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab11.asm. Identify the cause of each error.

line 14: missing the opcode to tell the program that x3000 is the origin address
line 16: because line 14 .ORIG is missing, so line 16 instruction before .ORIG causes an error
line 17: x3010 is not defined, so the constant -1 in x3010 is out of range
line 19: the operand is the error because there is an extra comma
line 30: the address x300F is not defined and clear R5 to 0 as intended
line 32: the order of nzp is reversed, p comes before z, so there is an error.
line 41: there is no statement telling to program to end

Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 

OUTERLOOP: x3005
INNERLOOP: x3006
INPUT: x300F
RESULT: x303F

I added the label ZERO and NegOne. Label ZERO is used to initialize to 0, and label NegOne is used to make R2 contain -1.


Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?

Using labels makes the most sense. This is because we can name them to make our program more understandable and improve the readability. It can also act as a reminder of the program of what that line is doing.
